Mesh-To-Occupancy-Map
=====================
Conversion from mesh (.ply files) to bitmap Occupancy map (.png file)

Example
-------
snap shot of the ply file (from tango dev kit):  
![mesh_snapshot](https://github.com/saeedghsh/Mesh-To-Occupancy-Map/blob/master/examples/mesh_snapshot.png)
<!-- <img src="url" alt="alt text" width="whatever" height="whatever"> -->

conversion result version .1 (pointset):  
![ogm_v.1](https://github.com/saeedghsh/Mesh-To-Occupancy-Map/blob/master/examples/20170131163311_.png)

conversion result version .2 (interactive raycast):  
![ogm_v.2](https://github.com/saeedghsh/Mesh-To-Occupancy-Map/blob/master/examples/20170131163311.png)

Laundry List
------------
- [ ] add slider for offset and interval
- [ ] draw lines from point to point during the interactive process
- [ ] title each figure with description (short instruction?)
- [ ] use skiz to pick raycasting points?
